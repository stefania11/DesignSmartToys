### Objectives:
Students will also design their own AI toys or construction kits which they will test in local communities (schools, libraries, museum, community centers). Final projects will be displayed in a play exhibition where all communities involved throughout the course will be invited to participate. 

### Description:
Much of our daily life is quietly being reshaped by AI while an entire generation of children is growing up with this technology in their homes. The best way to understand the algorithms that drive AI applications is to make your own -- to write and train them through playful and interactive activities. The Hacking Smart Toys for AI Learning course consists of a series of hands-on activities focused on designing and testing several smart toys, construction kits and play experiences that can support youth to better learn and play with AI. Both beginners and more advanced students are welcome. In this track participants will design with and hack existing smart toys and AI devices to support youth, families and educators to customize and appropriate these technologies in playful ways. The goal of the course is to imagine the future of smart toys and AI devices for youth and to explore the social and ethical conditions of children growing up with AI. The course will introduce students to different aspects of machine learning through play while engaging the local community of toy designers, artists, AI pioneers. The things we will do include writing applications for current smart toys and AI devices like Cozmo and Vector robots, Amazon's Alexa, Lego Wedo bricks. 
### Costs: 
Most of the class materials will be provided by the instructor, students will have to purchase materials for personal final projects and for home prototyping.

### Grading 
Half of the total grade is based on individual work and the other half is based on teamwork. Class and lab participation grades are based on both attendance and quality of in-class activity.

In Class Exercises: We will discuss why we play? How children started playing and what effect that had on their development? What are the opportunities and challenges of AI toys and devices for kids and why does it matter? We will also use random objects to create games based on a series of design constraints. 

Reading Assignment: "The Veldt" Short sci-fi story by Ray Bradbury (available [here!](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/163728/The%20Veldt%20-%20Ray%20Bradbury.pdf)
Design journal assignment: Share a story about an evocative object from your childhood 

#### Week 2: Explore play patterns with Lego Wedo 
<!-- -->
<!-- Date: 02.08.2019 -->
Discussion: Impressions and thoughts on "The Veld" short story
Review: First toy prototype enhancements.
Activity in class: We will create various protoypes of toys with Lego Wedo and learn how to program them. Then we will create enhancements for our toys to make them smart by connecting each prototype to one of the senses. 
Students will then divide into groups, pick some of the parts from different kits and try to combine them in unusual ways. We will also have crafting and prototyping materials for this part of the session. We will end with a play session where we all go around and play with each other creations and provide feedback on each other creations. 


Reading Assignments:
* [Characteristics of Boys' and Girls' Toys!](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-005-7729-0) - Judith Blakemore and Renee E. Centers

Production Assignment: Make groups of 2-3 students. Pick a persona (it can be a child or adult) and design an activity in which this person can learn with and about one of the smart toys presented in class. Try to make the activity as interactive, weird and unexpected as possible. Document your activity and make a 1 minute demo video in your design journal. 


#### Week 3: Learn from Toy Designers 
<!-- Date: 02.15.2019 -->

Research Assignment: Find a toy that you like (or dislike) and try to see how different stakeholders talk about it: how is it presented by the creators, how are parents and kids talking about it, does the toy match their expectations, do they use it in unusual ways? Analyze the toy you picked from all the different perspectives and discuss also cultural, SES and age differences in the recounts you encounter. Document and present your findings in your design journal. Drawings, collages or any other way to capture and present your conclusions are welcomed. 


#### Week 3:  Diving into smart toys: Cozmo, Hello Barbie and Sphero Mini


In Class Exercises: We will play with three connected toys(Cozmo, Hello Barbie and Sphero Mini) and then learn how to look behind the curtain and re-engineer them by using their SDKs, Cognimates and other platforms. Students will also learn how to analyze these toys by looking at their form factor, interaction design, play affordances, and many other criteria. We will also discuss co-designing for play and creative learning with youth and what are some of the most successful strategies for learning by playing and by doing.

<!-- Date: 03.01.2019 -->

Activity: We will visit an after-school center and play-test your lo-fi projects with kids and get their feedback. 
After introducing them to the lo-fi prototypes you will show them the other toys you got to use during the class and observe how they play with them, what they like and what they don't. What is unique about the way they play with a specific toy? Do they play alone or together? What are their feature requests? You will work in groups and use your field research methodology to best capture the findings. 

Reflection & production assignment: Go back to your lo-fi prototype and make changes based on kids feedback and field observations. Document your thinking and design process.

### STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY 

Plagiarism is presenting someone elseâ€™s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writerâ€™s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.
<!-- 
### STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE 

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html
